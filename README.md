# Project Description

Hungry but stuck in a never-ending canteen queue? Say hello to Grab&Go — your ticket to skipping the line and grabbing a hot meal in seconds!
Grab&Go is a web app that lets you pre-order from multiple cafeterias at once. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and backed by a PostgreSQL database, it handles:

- Passwordless user login via email OTPs

- Order tracking

- Admin dashboard for adding and managing food items easily

- Home page to scroll through delicious food items

# Problem Statement

- Endless Waiting: Students and staff waste precious breaks standing in long cafeteria queues.

- Limited Choice: You can only order from one canteen at a time, missing out on other nearby options.

- No Pre-Order Visibility: Without a unified system, you never know when your meal will actually be ready.

- Manual Menu Management: Cafeteria admins juggle spreadsheets or paper lists to update daily food items, leading to errors and delays.

- Fragmented User Data: Handling OTPs, passwords, and order history across multiple platforms is cumbersome and insecure.

Grab&Go tackles all of these by letting users pre-order from multiple cafeterias, track their meals in real time, and giving admins a single dashboard to manage menus and user data.
